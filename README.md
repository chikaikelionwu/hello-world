There’s a lot of hype out there about the next latest and greatest programming fad.
A lot of progress is being made in the programming world, but in general there’s not a silver-bullet single technology someone can learn that will immediately cure all their problems.

Beginners are often encouraged to start digging into solutions for problems they don’t understand yet.
The hype can cause someone to try to learn about things like the Virtual DOM, or Shadow DOM, before they even understand what the regular DOM is.
